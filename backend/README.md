## Cosmos - Node.js backend

This folder contains the backend for Cosmos WebRTC. In the current version it is highly coupled with the frontend, so it won't work without it.
In the future we plan to make a version which provides a couple of API to use it without the frontend (for now we just want to take the exam!).

Also keep an eye on the file "janus-event-handler-relay" which is a little trick to use the EventHandler Plugin also in localhost. If you want more info you can contact us.
